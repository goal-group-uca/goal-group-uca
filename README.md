# GOAL â€“ Graphical Methods, Optimization and Learning Research Group

The GOAL research group, standing for Graphical Methods, Optimization And Learning, focusses on the design of innovative methods based on artificial intelligence and graphical models, as well as their application to solve complex real world problems. Our activity is currently mainly focussed on optimization (continuous, combinatorial, dynamic and static, single- and multi-objective, exact algorithms, metaheuristics, parallelism,..), machine learning (SVMs, deep learning, neural networks, regression techniques), cybersecurity, IoT, fractal geometry, mobile and dynamic networks, sustainable computing (autonomous programming, automatic generation of energy-efficient SW, efficient resources management), and intelligent transportation systems.
